    "> A polynomial with one variable (by convention, we will write the variable as x) is either zero or the sum of a finite number of nonzero terms, e.g., 3x2 + 2x + 3. Each term, e.g., 3x2, consists of a constant (the coefficient of the term, 3 in this case) multiplied by the variable (x in this case) raised to a nonnegative integer exponent (2 in this case). The exponent on a variable in a term is called the degree of that term. The degree of a polynomial is the largest degree of any single term. Some examples are, 3 (degree 0), 2.5x + 12 (degree 1), and 3x2\n",
    "(degree 2). In contrast, 2/x and x0.5 are not polynomials."
